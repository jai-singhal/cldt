resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday december and i would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period
although as you will have seen the dreaded millennium bug failed to materialise still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful
you have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days during this part session
in the meantime i should like to observe a minute silence as a number of members have requested on behalf of all the victims concerned particularly those of the terrible storms in the various countries of the european union
please rise then for this minute silence
